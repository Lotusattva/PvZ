# Plants vs. Zombies
This is a personal project with intentions to develop skills in using external libraries and working with a graphical user interface.

The goal is to recreate a minimally playable game similar to Plants vs. Zombies.

The programming language of choice is C++. \

I am learning Java in school right now but I want to challenge myself with self-teaching a new language. C++ is a powerful language and it is not easy to master. Therefore, I believe this is a good choice for this personal project.

Documentation is only written for methods in base classes for now as many thing are going to change

## Building and Running
Use Cmake to build and run. Make sure the output binary is located within the same level as ```res/``` folder, otherwise nothing will be displayed. You may need to change CMakeLists.txt depending on your build/compile setup. 

For reference: I use Ninja as the build system and gcc as the compiler

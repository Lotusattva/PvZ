# Plants vs. Zombies
This is a personal project with intentions to develop skills in using external libraries and working with a graphical user interface.

The goal is to recreate a minimally playable game similar to Plants vs. Zombies.

The programming language of choice is C++. \

I am learning Java in school right now but I want to challenge myself with self-teaching a new language. C++ is a powerful language and it is not easy to master. Therefore, I believe this is a good choice for this personal project.

Documentation is only written for methods in base classes for now as many thing are going to change
